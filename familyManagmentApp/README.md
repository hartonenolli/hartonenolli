## <a id="tldr"></a>TL;DR
This is the first of my hobby projects. The purpose of the application is to make it easier to manage a family. The target group of the application is families experiencing peak years.

With multiple children, it can be difficult to remember everything about their school days, hobbies, birthdays, etc. (I've noticed this). Environmental variables like weather or allergies can affect your plans. The app takes these things into account, for example: by suggesting the right clothing for rainy days.
