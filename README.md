## <a id="introduction"></a>Introduction
The purpose of this repository is to make it easier to maintain hobby projects.

I want to develop programming skills, project management skills, and learn new things by challenging myself to try new technologies.

The repository contains projects in different folders. Inside each folder is a separate README.md file with information about the project. The information includes, among other things, initialization instructions, user manuals, project structure, and images.

## <a id="me"></a>About me
I am a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My interest is in software development and I would like to be part of a software development project. I am currently developing my skills and studying more. My programming skills include Python, javascript, React (MUI, Bootstrap, Redux, React Query), Node.js, MongoSQL, PostgreSQL, etc. (and I am studying more..)

Working with Github and using programming tools such as Github copilot are also familiar to me.

Here is a [link](https://github.com/hartonenolli) to my main page and to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olli-hartonen-ab915925a/). The software development project [website](https://ilmastokompassi.helsinki.fi/) and the Fullstack [course](https://fullstackopen.com/) github [repository](https://github.com/hartonenolli/fullstack) may also be interesting to look at.
