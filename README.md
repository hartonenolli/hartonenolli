## <a id="introduction"></a>Introduction
Hello and welcome to my Github page! Below you will find my activities and a few interesting repositories.

I want to develop programming skills, project management skills, and learn new things by challenging myself to try new technologies.

## <a id="me"></a>About me
I am a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My interest is in software development and I would like to be part of a software development project. I am currently developing my skills and studying more. My programming skills include Python, javascript, React (MUI, Bootstrap, Redux, React Query), Node.js, MongoSQL, PostgreSQL, etc. (and I am studying more..)

Working with Github and using programming tools such as Github copilot are also familiar to me.

Here is my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olli-hartonen-ab915925a/). The software development project [website](https://ilmastokompassi.helsinki.fi/) and the Fullstack [course](https://fullstackopen.com/) github [repository](https://github.com/hartonenolli/fullstack) may also be interesting to look at.
